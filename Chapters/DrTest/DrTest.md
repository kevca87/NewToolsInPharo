Have a set of testing is a fundamental for any project. (improve) In this chapter we present DrTest, an extendable, plugins-based UI for testing Pharo projects. DrTest stands as a testament to the robustness and flexibility of the Pharo ecosystem, offering a suite of functionalities tailored to streamline the testing process. Our objective here is twofold: first, to guide you through the effective utilization of DrTest and its accompanying plugins, and second, to empower you with the knowledge to craft your own DrTest plugins, thus extending its capabilities to suit your specific needs.

To achieve these aims, we embark on a journey that begins with an overview of existing plugins within the Pharo DrTest framework. Through illuminating examples, we showcase the rich tapestry of functionalities that these plugins bring to the testing landscape, emphasizing the importance and tangible benefits of incorporating them into your development workflow.

Furthermore, we dissect the anatomy of DrTest plugin creation, unraveling the purpose of key classes and methods integral to the process. With a meticulous step-by-step approach, we provide concrete examples to elucidate each stage, equipping you with the practical know-how to navigate the creation process seamlessly.

By the end of this chapter, you will not only possess a comprehensive understanding of DrTest and its plugins but also wield the proficiency to harness its full potential in your Pharo projects. Let us embark on this exploration of DrTest, where innovation meets pragmatism in the realm of software testing.
